# Cardio Calorie Calculator

Greetings

I use this project to calculate the calories I burn in my daily exercise.

It works by taking into account the type of exercise, intensity, and duration. For simplification, I categorized the type of workout and intensity together into several buttons so that the user will only have to input the duration of the exercise.

  For the calculations, I copied formulas from the internet.
